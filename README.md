# Waldo App - Game

This is the documentation for the Waldo App, a game where players search for Waldo in various pictures. The app utilizes Firestore for the scoreboard functionality and Webflow for the frontend design.

## Game Description

The Waldo App is a fun game that challenges players to find Waldo, the elusive character, in different pictures. The goal is to locate Waldo as quickly as possible to earn a high score.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: You can search for Waldo in various pictures, testing your observation skills.
- **Scoreboard**: The app includes a scoreboard to track and display the highest scores you achieve.
- **Webflow Integration**: The frontend design of the app is developed using Webflow, a powerful visual web design tool.
- **Firestore Integration**: The app integrates with Firestore, a flexible NoSQL database provided by Firebase, to manage the scoreboard functionality.

## Webflow Development Link

During the development of the Waldo App, I experimented with Webflow, a powerful visual web design tool. I used Webflow to create and refine the front-end design of the app. The Webflow development link allows you to preview the app's design and interact with its elements. Please note that this link is for development purposes only and may not reflect the final version of the app.

## Scoreboard
The Waldo App includes a scoreboard to track and display the highest scores achieved by players. The scoreboard functionality is implemented using Firestore, a flexible NoSQL database provided by Firebase.

To ensure a fair and competitive environment, the scoreboard records the time taken by each player to find Waldo. The scores are displayed in descending order, with the fastest times at the top.

## Firestore Integration
The Waldo App leverages Firestore, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database provided by Firebase, to manage the scoreboard functionality. Firestore allows storing and retrieving data in real-time, enabling seamless updates to the leaderboard as players achieve high scores.
