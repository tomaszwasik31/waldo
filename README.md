## Webflow Development Link

During the development of the Waldo App, I experimented with Webflow, a powerful visual web design tool. I used Webflow to create and refine the front-end design of the app. The Webflow development link allows you to preview the app's design and interact with its elements. Please note that this link is for development purposes only and may not reflect the final version of the app.

## Scoreboard
The Waldo App includes a scoreboard to track and display the highest scores achieved by players. The scoreboard functionality is implemented using Firestore, a flexible NoSQL database provided by Firebase.

To ensure a fair and competitive environment, the scoreboard records the time taken by each player to find Waldo. The scores are displayed in descending order, with the fastest times at the top.
